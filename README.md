# My Portfolio Projects

## Introduction

Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Shariq Khatri and glad you decided to stop by!

In this repository, you will come across several links to challenges that I have completed as part of my University of Toronto Data Science Bootcamp. These challenges demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, presentation skills, etc. A majority of my projects are done using the Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook. Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib. I have also created various projects that showcase my SQL and business intelligence. These projects include creating powerful dashboards to answer important business questions leveraging the power of tools like PowerBI and Tableau.
